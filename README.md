# mpv-video-manager

A basic video manager using MPV.

Most video players don't offer the ability to manage the files as well as play them. This solves the issue for me so I can manage the few thousand videos i need to sort without having to go back and forth to the file manager or terminal. Didn't want anything too bloated as I wanted to watch the videos in their entirety as part of managing them.


* Plays a directory of videos - not subfolders
* Either the Delete button or keyboard key will move the file to the trash/recycle bin.
* Lets you skip or go to the previous video with either the buttons or the arrow keys.
* After selecting a "move folder", the move button or M key will move the playing video


Needs MPV and the python libraries send2trash, guizero and mpv.

I use Linux and not too bothered about other platforms, so might need modifications to work on Windows or Mac.

Hope it helps someone else.
